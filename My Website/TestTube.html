        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>I am currently taking Computer Science III in high school, where the language we use is java, so I have about 3 years experience. This year in class we have focused on learning about various data structures and how to use them to solve
          simple problems.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>I have only just started teaching myself JavaScript and haven't done much with it other than work on small projects to learn the basics of the language. I plan in the future to use it more in personal projects outside of school.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>Just like JavaScript, I have only recently started learning HTML and CSS. I am using this webiste to imporve my web development skills. There are many things I don't know about web development that I wish to learn from this project of
          mine</p>
