    <h1>Coding Languages<h1>
        <h2>Java</h2>
        <p>I am currently taking Computer Science III in high school, where the language we use is java, so I have about 3 years experience. This year in class we have focused on learning about various data structures and how to use them to solve
          simple problems.</p>
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>I have only just started teaching myself JavaScript and haven't done much with it other than work on small projects to learn the basics of the language. I plan in the future to use it more in personal projects outside of school.</p>
        <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>Just like JavaScript, I have only recently started learning HTML and CSS. I am using this webiste to imporve my web development skills. There are many things I don't know about web development that I wish to learn from this project of
          mine.</p>
